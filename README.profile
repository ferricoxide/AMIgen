To properly use the files in this file-group, it is expected that you will
have set the following shell environmentals on your build system:

CHROOT:			Location of the target chroot() build-tree
			(e.g. "/mnt/ec2-root")

YUM0:			This should be set to the target distribution's ELx
			version number (e.g., "6.5")

PATH:			Update your normal path environmental variable to
			include the AWS CLI tools (can be set by declaring
			your path as ${PATH}:${EC2_HOME}/bin)

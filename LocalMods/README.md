This directory is maintained as an empty (but for this README) directory. It is expected that groups making use of the larger git-repository will store local customizations in this directory. Typical things to place here would be things like:
* Custom/internal yum repository definitions
* Custom/internal AMI-related configuration items (e.g., NTP or DNS directives for customers not passing such directives via DHCP-options)
* Custom extensions to the base RPM manifest
